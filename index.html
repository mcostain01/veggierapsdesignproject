                This website was created because 
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>I have too much time on my hands, and when I'm bored I write poems, raps and rhymes about legumes</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I had to do it for a school project</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>I wanted to share my veggie raps with the world, without having to rap them myself because well, I can't rap</li>
                </ol>
