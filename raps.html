                    It’s about the veggie that tastes all rough
                    <br>
                    Makes you cry when you cut it up 
                    <br>
                    Peel it’s skin put it in a cup
                    <br>
                    It’s got layers like ogres do

                    This cool plant has quite the sass
                    <br>
                    It would go real well on a nice black bass
                    <br>
                    You can afford even in the middle class
                    <br>
